      - Allow hiding the user-defined path and all its sub-paths from various system calls.
      - Effective on process with uid > 2000 only.
      - Use with cautious as it may cause performance loss and will be vulnerable to side channel attacks,
        just disable this feature if it doesn't work for you or you don't need it at all.

        and this reorder function will be effective on all processes spawned only by the zygote process.

      - Allow user to enable or disable core ksu kprobes hooks temporarily in runtime.
      - When enabling sus_su, kprobes of ksu will be disabled, and a fifo driver will be created in /dev/[random_string].
        (for first time only), then user needs to mount the 'sus_su' to /system/bin/su using overlayfs or whatever techniques,
        and run 'su' to get root shell from the fifo driver. Or, refer to the method in service.sh from module template.
      - When disabling sus_su, kprobes of ksu will be enabled again, and the fifo driver will be deleted.
      - Only apps with root access granted by ksu manager are allowed to get root.
      - Also overlayfs is required.
